This repo is not main repo of current project.

I use changes in this repo for my personal needs.

If you want to use jax-doclets, I advice you to use the original one at: https://github.com/FroMage/jax-doclets.

Diffs between current repo and original one:
- Generating of JAX-RS documentation from interfaces
- Version naming policy changed
